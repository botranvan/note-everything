# DEPRECATED
# "placement" has been deprecated since 18.0.0.
# This was a catch-all rule hard-coded into the placement service and
# has been superseded by granular policy rules per operation.
# This rule is used for all routes that do not yet have granular
# policy rules. It will be replaced with rule:admin_api.
